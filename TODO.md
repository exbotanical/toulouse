# TODOs

- [ ] multiboot 2 support
- [ ] a20 enablement and disk load retries
- [ ] debug mode
- [x] grub ingress
- [ ] any build warnings e.g. LOAD seg w/RWX perms
- [x] Split everything into submodules with their own Makefiles and unit tests so it's faster to rebuild and link parts of the kernel.

# Next Steps

- [ ] kfree
- [ ] mirror module structure in include (i.e. kernel/)
