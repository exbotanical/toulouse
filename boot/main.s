# The BIOS loads us into 16-bit real mode for backward compatibility purposes (i.e. old 8086 processors).
# That is, in this mode memory addresses are calculated using 16-bit values;
# we can directly address up to 64kb of memory, starting from address 0x00000 to 0xFFFFF.
# Therefore, we instruct the assembler to generate 16-bit machine code here,
# affecting the size of registers, instructions, and memory addresses.
# Note, we can use the segment registers to reference addresses up to 1Mb.

### GDT ###
# Addressing no longer works the way it did in 16-bit real mode.
# Now, we must define a data structure called the Global Descriptor Table (GDT)
# to tell the CPU how we want to segment memory.

# In short: rather than multiply the value of a segment register by 16 and then add to it
# the offset, a segment register becomes an index to a particular segment descriptor (SD) in the GDT.

# From: https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~exr/lectures/opsys/10_11/lectures/os-dev.pdf
# "
# The simplest workable configuration of segment registers is described by Intel as the
# "basic flat model", whereby two overlapping segments are defined that cover the full 4 GB
# of addressable memory, one for code and the other for data.
# The fact that in this model these two segments overlap means that there is no attempt to protect one segment from
# the other, nor is there any attempt to use the paging features for virtual memory.

# In addition to the code and data segments, the CPU requires that the first entry
# in the GDT purposely be an invalid null descriptor (i.e. a structure of 8 zero bytes).
# The null descriptor is a simple mechanism to catch mistakes where we forget to set a
# particular segment register before accessing an address, which is easily done if we had
# some segment registers set to 0x0 and forgot to update them to the appropriate segment
# descriptors after switching to protected mode. If an addressing attempt is made with the
# null descriptor, then the CPU will raise an exception (interrupt).
# "

# Note - we'll be using paging later so much of the GDT setup isn't going to be all that
# important for long.
