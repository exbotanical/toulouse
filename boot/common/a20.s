# The A20 line is a specific address line in the CPU's memory addressing system.
# The CPU uses address lines to access different memory locations.
# The A20 line is the 21st address line (starting from A0).
# As aforementioned, older CPUs like the 8086 could only address 1 MB of memory
# (20 address lines, A0 to A19).
# Even though they had 20-bit addresses, they could generate addresses beyond this
# limit thanks to segmentation.
# In these older CPUs, when an address exceeded 1 MB, it would "wrap around"
# to the beginning of memory. When newer CPUs like the 80286 were released,
# they could address more memory (over 1 MB) but they kept the wrap-around behavior
# for the sake of backward compatibility. The A20 line provides a means for disabling
# this behavior and allowing addressing above 1MB without wrapping. To do so, we
# must ensure the A20 bit is set to enabled.

# There's many ways to enable the A20 line, many of which depend on the chipset being used.
# A recommended way is:
# 1. First, test whether the BIOS has already enabled it (some do).
# 2. Try enabling via the BIOS in real mode.
# 3. Test BIOS enablement.
# 4. Try keyboard controller method.
# 5. Test if enabled in a loop with a time-out (keyboard ctrl method is often slow).
# 6. Try Fast A20.
# 7. Test if enabled in a loop with a time-out (I guess by "fast" they don't mean fast).
# 8. Failing all that, bork.
