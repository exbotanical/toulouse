# In 32-bit protected mode, we don't have access to BIOS interrupts.
# In order to print, we can write directly to the VGA video memory,
# the mapping of which begins at address 0xB8000.
# The VGA has a color text mode across a 80x25 character grid where each
# cell is represented by two bytes: the first is the ASCII code of the char to be displayed;
# the second encodes char attributes, such as fg/bg color, blinking, etc.

# To calculate char position, we can use the following formula: 0xb8000 + 2 * (row * 80 + col)
